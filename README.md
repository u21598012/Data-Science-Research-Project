# Data-Science-Research-Project
Exploration of a dataset using R

The following problem statement was considered for the project: 

The objective of this project is to use R to explore the Crime Statistics dataset and come 
up with some interesting questions which you should answer using all the knowledge 
you’ve learned in WST212. The project is open-ended with no one single set of correct 
solutions. 

The Crime Statistics dataset to be used contains South African crime statistics, broken 
down per province, station and crime type.

To motivate why particular methods/tools were chosen, your project should include 
each of the following components:
1. Data exploration – which incorporates the use of SQL, plots, and any other relevant
statistical techniques to further explore the data.
2. Data modelling - the use of statistical modelling techniques to observe and capture
the underlying trends present within the data.
3. Conclusion – provide a comprehensive conclusion of all the interesting insights that 
you obtained from your analysis, whether the models fitted to the data are 
appropriate, and why if-at-all a model was useful given the dataset.
